# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the information security (infosec) considerations and best practices for Data Doctor. It is intended for administrators, developers, and users responsible for deploying and maintaining the application.

# 2. Security Principles

- **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
- **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability:** Ensure the tool and data are accessible to authorized users

# 3. Data Protection

## 3.1 Sensitive Data
- Database credentials, API keys, and passwords are stored in environment variables (`.env` files)
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Sensitive files should be excluded from version control (`.gitignore`)

## 3.2 Data in Transit
- Recommend using HTTPS for remote access to the Streamlit app
- Database connections should use SSL/TLS where possible

## 3.3 Data at Rest
- Database files and local data should be stored on encrypted disks where possible
- Regular backups should be performed and stored securely

# 4. Authentication & Access Control

- (Optional) Enable user authentication for the Streamlit app
- Use least-privilege database accounts (read-only where possible)
- Restrict file access to necessary directories only
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts

# 5. Network Security

- Run the Streamlit app and database on trusted networks
- Use firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports (e.g., 8502 for Streamlit, 5432 for PostgreSQL)
- Do not expose database or admin interfaces to the public internet

# 6. Logging & Monitoring

- Enable application logging for audit and troubleshooting
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity
- Regularly review logs for security events

# 7. Compliance & Privacy

- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)
- Do not store or process more data than necessary
- Provide users with information about data usage and retention

# 8. Secure Development & Maintenance

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Apply security patches promptly
- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Use static analysis tools where possible

# 9. Incident Response

- Have a documented process for responding to security incidents
- Regularly test backup and recovery procedures
- Notify affected users and stakeholders in the event of a breach

# 10. Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables used for all credentials
- [ ] Strong passwords and least-privilege accounts
- [ ] Network access restricted by firewall
- [ ] Regular backups and secure storage
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled
- [ ] Dependencies kept up to date
- [ ] Incident response plan in place
